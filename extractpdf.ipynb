      "### **i. Exposure-safety analyses conducted to support dose selection**  \n",
      "The exposure-safety analyses evaluated relationships between ocrelizumab exposure (measured by average concentration, **Cmean**) and adverse events, including:  \n",
      "- **Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)**  \n",
      "- **Serious Infections (SIs)**  \n",
      "- **Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs)**  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Key Findings**:  \n",
      "- No exposure-response relationship was observed for **SAEs** or **SIs** across exposure quartiles at the 600 mg dose.  \n",
      "- **IRRs** were numerically higher in the 1000 mg group (from Phase 2) but not in higher exposure quartiles of the 600 mg group.  \n",
      "- No correlation between ocrelizumab exposure and severity of adverse events.  \n",

      "- **Primary Progressive MS (PPMS)**: Time to CDP, changes in brain volume, and 25-Foot Walk Test.  \n",

      "- The highest dose tested in Phase 2 for MS was **2000 mg** (vs. the approved 600 mg), but no MTD was identified due to:  \n",
      "  - Comparable safety between 600 mg and higher doses.  \n",
      "  - Lack of dose-limiting toxicities.  \n",
      "- The **600 mg dose** was selected based on B-cell depletion plateauing at doses ≥400 mg and comparable efficacy/safety to higher doses.  \n",

      "The FDA’s **Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics Review** for Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) analyzed exposure-safety and exposure-efficacy relationships to support the 600 mg dose selection. Exposure-safety assessments evaluated adverse events, including serious infections (SIs) and infusion-related reactions (IRRs), but found no clear correlation with ocrelizumab exposure (measured by average concentration, **Cmean**). Exposure-efficacy analyses for **relapsing MS (RMS)** and **primary progressive MS (PPMS)** indicated that higher exposures (top quartile) were associated with reduced disability progression (CDP), though trends were inconsistent for other endpoints like brain atrophy. Due to limited Phase 3 dose-ranging data—only 600 mg was tested—the FDA cautioned against conclusions supporting alternative dosing. No **post-marketing requirements (PMRs)** were mandated for dose selection, as the 600 mg dose was deemed adequately justified. The **maximum tolerated dose (MTD)** was not formally established, but 600 mg was selected because efficacy plateaued above 400 mg without dose-limiting toxicities, even at higher tested doses (e.g., 2000 mg). Overall, the FDA concluded that the 600 mg regimen, administered every six months, balanced safety and efficacy without requiring further dose optimization.\n"
